#### **ObjectNat** is an open-source library created for geospatial analysis created by **IDU team**

## Features and how to use

1. **[Isochrones and Transport Accessibility](./examples/isochrone_generator.ipynb)** â€” Isochrones represent areas reachable from a starting point within a given time limit along a transport network. This function enables analysis of transport accessibility using pedestrian, automobile, public transport graphs, or their combination.

   The library offers multiple isochrone generation methods:
   - **Baseline isochrones**: show a single area reachable within a specified time.
   - **Stepped isochrones**: show accessibility ranges divided into time intervals (e.g., 5, 10, 15 minutes).

   </p>


2. **[Coverage Zones](./examples/graph_coverage.ipynb)** â€” Function for generating **coverage zones** from a set of source points using a transport network. It calculates the area each point can reach based on **travel time** or **distance**, then builds polygons via **Voronoi diagrams** and clips them to a custom boundary if provided.

   </p>
 
3. **[Service Provision Analysis](./examples/calculate_provision.ipynb)** â€” Function for evaluating the provision of residential buildings and their population with services (e.g., schools, clinics)
    that have limited **capacity** and a defined **accessibility threshold** (in minutes or distance). The function models **demand-supply balance**, estimating how well services meet the needs of nearby buildings within the allowed time.

   The library also supports:
   - **Recalculation** of existing provision results using a new time threshold.
   - **Clipping** of provision results to a custom analysis area (e.g., administrative boundaries).

   </p>

4. **[Visibility Analysis](./examples/visibility_analysis.ipynb)** â€” Function for estimating visibility from a given point or multiple points to nearby buildings within a certain distance.
   This can be used to assess visual accessibility in urban environments.
   The library also includes a **catchment area calculator** for large-scale visibility analysis based on a dense grid of observer points (recommended: ~1000 points spaced 10â€“20 meters apart).
   Points can be generated using a road network and distributed along edges.

   The module includes:
   - A **fast approximate method** for large datasets.
   - A **accurate method** for detailed local analysis.

5. **[Noise Simulation](./examples/noise_simulation.ipynb)** â€” Simulates noise propagation from a set of source points, taking into account **obstacles**, **vegetation**, and **environmental factors**.

   </p>


6. **[Point Clusterization](./examples/point_clusterization.ipynb)** â€” Function to generate **cluster polygons** from a set of input points based on:
   - Minimum **distance** between points.
   - Minimum **number of points** per cluster.

   Additionally, the function can calculate the **relative ratio** of different service types within each cluster, enabling spatial analysis of service composition.

## City graphs

To ensure optimal performance of ObjectNat's geospatial analysis functions, it's recommended to utilize urban graphs sourced from the [IduEdu](https://github.com/DDonnyy/IduEdu) library.
**IduEdu** is an open-source Python library designed for the creation and manipulation of complex city networks derived from OpenStreetMap data. 

**IduEdu** can be installed with ``pip``:
```
pip install IduEdu
```
## Installation

**ObjectNat** can be installed with ``pip``:

```
pip install ObjectNat
```
### Configuration changes

```python
from objectnat import config

config.change_logger_lvl('INFO')  # To mute all debug msgs
config.set_enable_tqdm(False)  # To mute all tqdm's progress bars
```
