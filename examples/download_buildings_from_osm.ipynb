    "This function downloads building geometries from OpenStreetMap (OSM) for a specified territory and assigns attributes to each building. Specifically, it determines whether a building is residential (`is_living` attribute) and estimates the approximate number of inhabitants (`approximate_pop` attribute).\n",
    "\n",
    "The function works as follows:\n",
    "- Downloads all buildings from osm using osmnx library.\n",
    "- Residential Classification (`is_living`): Based on the building type, the function classifies buildings as either residential or non-residential.\n",
    "- Population Estimation (`approximate_pop`):\n",
    "If a building's area is less than 400 m² and it has no more than 2 floors, it is considered a private house with 3 inhabitants.\n",
    "For other residential buildings, the population is calculated as (`number of floors` * `living area`) / `area_per_person`, where `area_per_person`  is the standard living space per person (33 m² by default).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### If you have a real population value in the chosen area, recommend using this [model](restore_population.pynb) to restore the population more accurately. "
