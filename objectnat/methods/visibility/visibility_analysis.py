    Compute a high-accuracy visibility polygon for a single observer point.

    This function implements a detailed line-of-sight algorithm based on obstacle

    * A circular buffer with radius ``view_distance`` is built around the
      observer point.
    * Obstacles intersecting this buffer are selected.
    * Polygonal obstacles are converted to line boundaries and exploded into
      individual segments.
    * For each nearest wall segment, a visibility wedge (sector) is constructed
      using angular relationships between wall endpoints and the observer.
    * All wedges are combined and subtracted from the initial visibility buffer
      together with obstacles to obtain the final visible area.
